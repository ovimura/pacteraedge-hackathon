Query 1. Rank 10 stores has lowest overall average weekly sales. If there is a tie between two

select st, avg_ws, rank() over( order by avg_ws asc) as RANK from 
(select st, avg_ws from 
(select Store st, avg(Weekly_Sales) avg_ws from sales_data
group by Store)
order by 2 ASC limit 10);



Query 2: For each type of the stores, find 5 stores with highest average weekly sales.

create table high_avg_ws_A as 
select st.Type, st.store, avg(sa.Weekly_Sales) from stores_data st inner join sales_data sa on st.store = sa.store
where st.Type = 'A'
group by 1, 2
order by 3 desc limit 5;

create table high_avg_ws_B as 
select st.Type, st.store, avg(sa.Weekly_Sales) from stores_data st inner join sales_data sa on st.store = sa.store
where st.Type = 'B'
group by 1, 2
order by 3 desc limit 5;


create table high_avg_ws_C as 
select st.Type, st.store, avg(sa.Weekly_Sales) from stores_data st inner join sales_data sa on st.store = sa.store
where st.Type = 'C'
group by 1, 2
order by 3 desc limit 5;


select type, Store, "avg(sa.Weekly_Sales)" as avg_weely_sales from high_avg_ws_A
UNION
select * from high_avg_ws_B
UNION
select * from high_avg_ws_C;



Query 3: Find stores with increased total sales in December from 2010 to 2011.

select Store, Date, Weekly_Sales, substr(Date, 7,4) year from sales_data
where (substr(Date, 7,4) = '2010' or substr(Date, 7,4) = '2011') and (substr(Date, 4,2) == '12')
group by 1, 2;
